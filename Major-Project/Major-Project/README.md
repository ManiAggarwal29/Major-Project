The Bus Ticket Booking System is a C program that allows users to book bus tickets based on available destinations. The program:
Displays a list of destinations and corresponding buses.
Lets the user select a destination and the number of tickets.
Calculates the total fare automatically.
Stores booking details (name, bus number, destination, tickets, and fare) in a file called records.txt.
Provides a simple menu-driven interface to book tickets or view existing bookings.
The code uses structures to store bus and booking information and file handling to save and read booking records. It also demonstrates conditional statements, loops, and basic input/output operations in C.
