# Bus Ticket Booking System

## Description
The Bus Ticket Booking System is a console-based application designed to simplify the process of reserving bus tickets. It allows users to view available buses, check seat availability, book tickets, cancel reservations, and generate booking receipts.
This project demonstrates the use of structured programming in C, modular code organization, file handling, and user-interactive menu-driven design. It can be used as a mini-project for academic purposes or as a foundation for more advanced transport management systems.
